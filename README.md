## Problem Statement

Tomato diseases can significantly affect crop yield and quality. Existing datasets, such as PlantVillage, are limited to lab-controlled environments. Tomato-Village addresses this gap by providing a new dataset for real-world scenarios, including categories like Leaf Miner, Spotted Wilt Virus, and Nutrition Deficiency Diseases.
